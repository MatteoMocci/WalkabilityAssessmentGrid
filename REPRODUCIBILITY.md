# Reproducibility Guide Moved

The primary reproducibility instructions are now maintained in `README.md`.

Use:
- `README.md` for the full training/evaluation pipeline and produced results.
- `zero-shot.md` for no-training evaluation workflow.
- `overview.md` for a file-by-file repository map and required components.
